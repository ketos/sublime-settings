Sublime Text 2 - sublime-settings Snippets
=======================

This is a Collection of Snippets for Sublime-Settings Files. Needs [AAAPackageDev](https://github.com/SublimeText/AAAPackageDev) for the Sublime Settings Syntax.

##Installation

**With Git:** Goto your Package-Dir (Preferences -> Browse Packages) and to the ***User*** folder, then

    git clone git@github.com:ketos/sublime-settings.git

So the structure should look like this:

    .../Packages/User/sublime-settings/

**With Package Manager:** *Not possible yet.*

***Important***

Create or edit the file named "Sublime Settings.sublime-settings" in your User directory so it looks like this:

    {
        "extensions":
        [
            "sublime-settings",
            "sublime-project",
            "sublime-workspace"
        ]
    }
